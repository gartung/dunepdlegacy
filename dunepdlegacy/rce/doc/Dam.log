Legacy support -- only the generic X86-64 libraries will be supported.
AVX never had a separate library from the generic one, and AVX2 did 
not run on all machines (only Haswell and newer)

WIB Frame with interleaved ADC bytes
------------------------------------
The original definition of the WIB frame was tightly packed 12-bit ADCs.
This definition was changed in Sep, but knowledge of this did not reach
me till Dec. There was many machinations about the WIB data not being
correctly transported, but this was all due to this change of format. 
The WIB test pattern (a constant 0xFEx, where X = Wib fiber number) was
not rich enough to see discern the pattern.  With this pattern, the
simplist explanation was the bytes where being duplicated.  

This was finally sorted out, but meant the RCE chain of firmware/software
had to be modified to be correctly interpretted. The best path forward was
decided to be
   1) Have Larry modify the WIB emulation in the RCE to match this new
      format.  
   2) Leave the HLS firmware as is, since at this point only raw WIB frames
      are being transported. All that matters is the same amount of data
      appears.  The RCE, for the most part does not care about the ADC 
      values.
   3) Modified proto-dune-dam-lib to read this new data.

This strategy needs only immediate modification to proto-dune-dam-lib. The
rest can wait until the RCE needs to understand how to correctly assess the
ADCs.  Until then, the cold data stream in the WIB frame are just a
bag-of-bits. 

Modified files
   1) dam/source/cc/src/WibFrame-avx2.hh
   2) dam/source/cc/src/WibFrame-gen.hh


Eliminate use of CLASS_UNUSED_MEMBER
------------------------------------
Modified so that the #define CLASS_UNUSED_MEMBER is no longer required.
This was eliminated in
   1) dam/access/TpcFragment.hh
   2) dam/access/TpcRanges.hh
   3) dam/access/TpcStream.hh

In doing so eliminated the setting of this in CPPFLAGS  from
  1) makeutils/define_tool.mk

The method is a bit kludgy.  A inline private method was defined that
accessed the unused class member.  Given that it is an inline and private
it will not generate any code, so except for adding noise (why is this
thing here) it is beign.

This is currently only a problem with the clang compiler, which seems to
have better error checking that gcc 6.3. But, there is no reason in the
future that gcc will not declare this an error also.

An interesting side note.  I initially added the methods to the class,
but, due to an oversight, provided no implementation.  However, clang
ceased to complain, even though the field member was still unused. A
little investigating seemed to reveal that placing an implemented method
in the class suppressed the unused field member error.  So one unused
method seems to mask the unused field member error.  (Two wrongs make
a right?) This has got to be a compiler mistake. 


Add exclusion of *~ files
--------------------------
Modified .gitignore to ignore *~ files.


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# VERSION : 0.0.3
# RELEASED: 2017.11.30
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor changes
   1. Add some additional checking to PdReaderTest
      This really needs to be formalized as a utility rather than as
      a means of checking the interface code.
   2. Fixed a minor error in define_tools.mk to correctly check for an
      empty string.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# VERSION : 0.0.2
# RELEASED: 2017.11.10
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support for builds on the MAC.  Surprisingly there were almost no
changes because of this to the package specific (here dam) Makefile.
These changes were due to name changes and version number updates. The
name changes were because of a poor selection.  'reader' was just too
generic to expose.

The main activity was
  1. Changing include file names
     For example malloc.h does not exist on the Mac, this information
     is present in stdlib.h.
  2. The compiler on the Mac caught a few errors that the 6.2 compiler
     on Linux did not. These were fixed.
  3. memalign does is not supported.   Had to use posix_memalign.
  

Name Changes
  1.  reader -> PdReaderTest
  2   wibFrame_test -> PdWibFrameTest

File changes
  1. dam/access/TpcFragment.hh
     a) Compiler complained that the class member m_df was unused.
     This seems to be a mistake on the compiler, because it is
     initialized in the class constructor.  Nevertheless, to make
     progress, it has been marked with __attribute__ ((unused))
     
  2. dam/access/TpcRanges.hh
     a) Marked class field member m_rsvd as unused in three different
     classes ((TpcRangesIndices, TpcRangesTimestamps, TpcRangeWindow).
     This field is used to pad to an integral 64-bit boundary.

  3. dam/access/TpcStream.hh
     a) Removed a commented out include file (dam/records/Data.hh"
     b) Marked file member m_rsvd as unused.

  4. dam/access/AignedAllocator.hh
     a) Had to change malloc.h -> stdlib.h (no malloc.h on the Mac)
     b) Had to use posix_memalign (no memalign on the Mac)

  5. make/Makefile
     a) Change so the common build is x86_64.  This covers the builds
     for Linux and the Mac.
     b) Set the name of the shareable suffix to .so for Linux
        .dylib for Mac. 
        The makeutilities should provide a function to do this so
        that this is not in the user's Makefile
     c) reader -> PdReaderTest
     d) wibFrame_test -> PdWibFrameTest
     e) Version -> 0.0.2
     
 6. TpcPacket files
     Replaced the misguided locateWibFrame(s) methods with a formal
     method to locate the first WIB frame in each (nominally) 1024
     packet.

 7. TpcToc
    Added a method to get the number of WibFrames in each packet.
    Of course, one must verify that the data packets are WibFrames.
    Nominally this number is 1024, but this method insulates the 
    user from changes.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# VERSION : 0.0.1
# RELEASED: 2017.10.23
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

This comes much closer to a production release.  This is still a 0.x.x
release meaning it is still evolving.  I am not confident that I have
isolated the user from anticipated changes.  It may take one more round
and a little experience.

CODE ORGANIZATION
-----------------
The include files have been organized as follows  

1. dam/ 
   Where the includes defining the high-level interface reside.  These
   are expected to be sufficient for most users.


2. dam/access
   The low-level access routines reside here. Most users will not use
   these.  However debugging and certain diagnostic code will find these
   useful.  The high-level interface is built on top of this interface.

3. dam/records
   The definitions of the physical data layout (except for WibFrame) 
   reside here.  While this is still in the public include file area,
   it is not meant to be included in user code. This is more so that 
   outside users can see the layout.  It is subject to change whereas
   those in dam/ and dam/access should be very stable


SHAREABLES
----------
There are 3 shareables now produced
    1. One for generic x86 64-bit architectures
    2. One for those CPUs with AVX support
    3. One for those CPUS with AVX2 support

Currently the AVX image is the same as the generic image.  A subsequent
release will specialize this image for AVX.

SETUP SCRIPTS
-------------
A setup script, scripts/settings.csh or settings.sh will setup PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to select the most efficient implementation for
that executing platform.
